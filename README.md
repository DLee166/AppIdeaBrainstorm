### App Description
This app is intended to connect people within professional industries. It will specifically target college students, but potentially anyone can and wants to use it. The goal is to help young professionals, at the beginning of their careers, develop meaningful connections with experienced members of their respective industries so they can better prepare themselves to be members of said industries. 

### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: While the idea of connecting people together is obviously not very unique to mobile, we think that connecting people with possible mentors is a process easily streamlined when on a mobile interface. 
- Story: Anyone seeking guidance or feedback in their careers (or maybe even in life) would likely find this app extremely useful because it would help them easily connect to people who specifically meet certain criteria
- Market: The app would specifically target college students in professional industries, but could potentially be used by anyone seeking a mentor. 
- Habit: Every 1-2 days
- Scope: All ages, but particularly most useful for those who want to build their professional network.
