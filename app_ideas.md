## New App ideas - categorization and evaluation
### Mentor App
- **Description:** Unfortunately not everyone will grow up with a father/ mother figure. Will allow kids to connect with a replacement father/ mother.  
- **Category:** Kids, Education , Life.
- **Mobile:** Will work on all platforms, but moblie is great for messages / meeting information.
- **Story:** For those who wish for additional aid in life.
- **Market:** Membership fees / donations
- **Scope:**
### Fridge food tracker
- **Descrption:** Allows users to keep track of perishable foods using expiration dates and accepted lifespans (for foods such as eggs) and sends reminders to eat/consume them before they expire. 
- **Category:** Health & Fitness
- **Mobile:** Excellent for mobile; on a desktop, the reminders/notifications would be too tedious. Also, users are more likely to be around their phones than their computers at any given moment. 
- **Story:** For those of us who are likely to forget about foods in the fridge, this is a great way to avoid letting food go to waste. 
- **Market:** Anyone with a smart phone and a fridge? 
- **Habit:** Frequency would depend how often one puts food inside their fridge. Could be weekly, bi-weekly or even daily.
